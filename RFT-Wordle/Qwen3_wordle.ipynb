Or is the word list the list of possible words? Wait, the problem says that the current game state includes a word list, which I think is the list of possible words that are allowed. Wait, no, maybe the word list is the list of words that are possible candidates. Wait, the user says \"Word list: [list of words]\". So that's the list of words that are allowed.
